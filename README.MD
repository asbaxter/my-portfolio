This is my first attempt at building a resposive and interactive website. The goal of this project was to create a webpage that was functional and interactive on all media platforms. Create code that was well orginized and effecient and a webpage that could be easily changed and altered through variables. This was a great challenge building a website from scratch. I was able to learn a lot from creating this website and all in all I am happy with the result.
